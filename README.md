# My Portfolio

## Description

This is the portfolio of James Waller Jr (AKA DistantDig). I wrote all of it myself in react javascript, and included a bit of information about myself as well as a few links to my projects, socials or resume. This project is designed to hold a collection of my own work and compile all of my accomplishments in a single place. While it is still simplistic for now I plan to redesign as time goes on so that it is always an accurate representation of my goals, my projects and my skill level. I'm always looking to grow in my skills, so any contribution or constructive criticism is appreciated!

## Content

My portfolio has several of my projects listed as well as some information about myself. Several of my projects are minecraft mods, among a few web applications. Each mod is written in java and json, and each project link leads to the download page of each mod. From there, there are several links at the top of the page that could be useful. Most notably the 'Files' and 'Source' tabs lead to a downloadable file and the Github repository respectively. It's also useful to note that the 'Issues' tab will send the user directly to the 'Issues' tab in the Github repository for convenient bug reporting. Linking the download page rather than the repository directly is etiquette in the modding community, and is often the primary place to showcase your mod. A screenshot of the tabs on the download page is included below to help grasp this explanation. The source tab is also circled for those who are searching specifically for the Github repository. For the regular website applications, the project link will lead to the Github repository directly.

**The Github repositories of Immersive Jungles and TreeLib are private per my partner's request, apologies.**

Other than my projects, my portfolio has several links on the page that should prove useful. A link to each section is included at the top of the page for your convenience and my practice. You should find a page for a short description about me, a contact form (which currently does not send information anywhere), and a resume tab for viewing and downloading my work history and skills.

## Credits

Some of my projects I partnered with Kekie6 who is *much* more talented than I when it comes to art. Kekie designed the logos, banners and all assets of any projects we worked together on. We also worked side by side on the code aspect of our projects, both helping each other to learn and grow in Java. Rightly so, he deserves the credit for his work. His Github link is [here](https://github.com/Kekie6) for anyone interested. For several of the web applications I worked on, I again was not alone. Each person I worked with is amazing in their own right and should be credited for their work. Since the list of fellow collaborators grows so quickly, I cannot list them all here. Each project has a list of their authors however within their respective READMEs for a list of all contributing members on the project.
