            Hiya! My name is James Waller Jr. but I also go by DistantDig online. My main passion is creating through code, and I work each day to grow in my skills. 
            I currently am learning how to write in HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the purpose of full stack web design. I also enjoy coding in my free time but that 
            looks more like modding games through Java. You can check out some of the things I've done so far in the Projects tab!
